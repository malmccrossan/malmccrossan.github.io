            <h3>Broad Street Park</h3>
            <p>This is one of the best park to find mushy crab apples in. The surrounding vegetation provides
                ample mushy apples and you could fill a decent sized sock in a few seconds. Great park for a day out and about picking
                fruit for a dinner time pie.

            <h3>Elgin Park</h3>
            <p> Elgin Park is the worst. There is a dog there called Scradly who lives in a shed behind the park.
                He and his dumb little red leash follow me around barking and biting at my achilles tendon, the most 
                vulnerable of all my tendons. He can take his soggy little eyes and jog-off.

            <h3>Hamilton Park</h3>
            <p>Oh boy, where to start with Hamilton Park, not only does this park have huge rocks that keep the local 
                rednecks from doing burnouts on the grass, it also has a field with the least amout of broken glass I've seen in a long time.
                This park offers year round fun, with grass in the summer, muddy puddles in the fall, and snow in the winter. If you're lucky 
                you may even get to see the local pack of wild dogs that like to howl in the gravel lot behind the park. A must see attraction.

            <h3>Mayor Flynn Park</h3>
            <p> Mayor Flynn Park is a staple in the underground sledding community. It offers a hill slightly bigger than the ditch by the Kent Street Tim Hortons.
                Childen line up for hours to shred down this tubular "pow" hill and try to run into each others shins. Do bring earplugs if you're someone who cherishes their eardrums and or sanity.

            <h3>McDonnell Park</h3>
            <p>McDonnell Park is widely known to provide the best ski-doo watching this side of the river. This location sports the odd
                flotsam of cigarette butts and a dead duck or two. The main attraction is watching a "Steve" or "Frank" rip up and 
                down this river by the park doing sick wake tricks and making as much noise as possible.

            <h3>Northlin Park</h3>
            <p> Northlin: "The best place to fall on your face", this park is always visited by the families that have the less than coordinated children. 
                There is a reason for the love of this park, the woodchips, these soft-wood, cedar and oak chipped bed of wonders is a savior to parents and children alike.
                A good tumble and a face to the ground will bounce off with the spring of a good pogo stick, and the wee-one will be ready to keep playing. 
                This park has been concrete and tear free since 93'.

            <h3>Old Mill Park</h3>
            <p>There is a reason they call this park Old Mill Park, why its Old Mill of course. As seen above, Mill himself is sitting by his beloved boat called 
                "Beers, Bass, Burgers". If you head down on Tuesday nights from 7-9 Old Mill himself will play you a diddy on his 3 stringed guitar and fry
                up some perch caught 5 weeks ago. Try to avoid the perch.

            <h3>Rivera Park</h3>
            <p>This is one of the fanciest parks in Lindsay, you can tell by the name, its not "River" park its "Rivera" notice the "a" at the end
                also known as the Spanish word for RIVER. Take your loved one to walk by the Rivera Park, they will think of you as high society.
